# InstaSwap

<h3>The official instagram app (from Microsoft Store, for Computers) does not have a function to see the other pictures of the post</h3>
<h3>For example when you have a post and you swipe to the left to see the other pictures</h3>

<h3>The only way you can do it on Computer (I think), is by using a mouse wich has a scroll to the sides, and if you don't you can use this YAY</h3>

<h3>When running <i>script.py</i> you can swipe images using the right button of the mouse and swiping to the side you want</h3>
<h4>This will also work for swiping stories</h4>
